## Approaches undertaken

**Group 1:**

**Group 2:**

-   The **AUD (EMA30 and EMA70)** and **CAD (EMA40 and EMA70)** strategies, with their lower period EMAs, may generate more trading signals and could potentially capture trends quicker, but this could also lead to more false signals and higher transaction costs due to more frequent trading.

-   The **XAG (EMA50 and EMA80)** strategy, with its higher period EMAs, would be slower to react to price movements, potentially reducing the number of trades and false signals.

## Finally selected strategy for **group 1**

For both asset (NQ and SP) I chose trade based on a Moving Average Crossover strategy using the 55-period and 80-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). The use of EMA55 and EMA80 suggests that a trade is initiated when the shorter EMA (55) crosses the longer EMA (80). If EMA55 crosses above EMA80, it might signal a buy, and if it crosses below, it might signal a sell.

```

**2021_Q1:** High positive Sharpe ratios and Calmar ratios indicate a very profitable quarter with high returns and acceptable risk.

**2021_Q3:** Negative netSR and netCR, and a negative netPnL suggest that this quarter saw losses that were significant compared to the risk taken.

**2021_Q4:** Very high gross and net Sharpe and Calmar ratios, coupled with high profits, indicate an excellent performance.

**2023_Q1:** A return to high positive ratios and profits, suggesting a strong recovery from the previous year's losses.

**2023_Q2:** Positive ratios and profits, although lower than 2023_Q1, still indicate a profitable quarter.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2021Q1

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2021_Q1.png")

```

-   **Profit and Loss Tracking**: The blue line tracks the gross PnL, which shows the profit or loss before transaction costs. The red line tracks the net PnL, which is the profit or loss after accounting for a transaction cost of \$10 per trade.

-   **Quarterly Peaks and Troughs**: The highest peak in mid-March shows the point at which the strategy was most profitable before a subsequent decline. This could indicate a strong market movement that was successfully captured by the strategy before a reversal or increased market volatility.

-   **End-of-Quarter Performance**: Both PnL lines decline towards the end of the quarter, with the net PnL (red line) showing a steeper decline. This suggests that while the strategy was still profitable, the profits were reduced by transaction costs and possibly other factors such as unfavorable market movements or slippage.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2021Q3

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2021_Q3.png")

```

-   **Fluctuations**: Both lines show significant fluctuations, indicating a volatile performance throughout the quarter.

-   **Peaks and Troughs**: There are several peaks and troughs in both lines, suggesting that the strategy had periods of both gains and losses.

-   **Transaction Costs Impact**: The red line is consistently below the blue line, reflecting the impact of transaction costs on the strategy's profitability.

-   **Recovery and Decline**: The last part of the quarter shows a sharp increase in gross PnL followed by a steep decline, which is mirrored in the net PnL though the decline brings the net PnL below zero, indicating that the strategy ended the quarter at a loss after costs.

-   **End of Quarter**: The quarter ends with the gross PnL above zero, suggesting some level of profitability before costs, while the net PnL is negative, showing a loss after costs.

In short, the trading strategy experienced a tumultuous quarter with volatile performance and ended with a gross profit that was overshadowed by a net loss when accounting for transaction costs.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2021Q4

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2021_Q4.png")

```

-   **Overall Trend**: Both the gross PnL (blue line) and net PnL (red line) exhibit a generally upward trend throughout the quarter, indicating that the trading strategy was profitable over this period.

-   **PnL Growth**: Starting from October, the PnL steadily grows, with both gross and net figures showing an increase, suggesting that the strategy was consistently generating positive returns.

-   **Transaction Cost Impact**: The gap between the gross and net PnL lines represents the impact of transaction costs. While both lines trend upwards, the net PnL is consistently lower than the gross PnL, which is expected due to the cost of trades.

-   **End-of-Quarter Performance**: The strategy's performance seems to peak towards the end of December, with the gross PnL reaching the highest point in the quarter. The net PnL also reaches a peak, although it is slightly lower due to transaction costs.

-   **Concluding Performance**: The quarter concludes with a high gross profit and a slightly lower net profit, demonstrating the success of the strategy after accounting for transaction costs.

This quarter appears to have been particularly successful for the trading strategy with the EMA55 and EMA80 crossover signals resulting in significant profitability.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2022Q2

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2022_Q2.png")

```

-   **Volatility**: There is considerable volatility throughout the quarter, with both profits and losses.

-   **Gross PnL (Blue Line)**: Shows a fluctuating performance with moments of profit that are later offset by losses, ending the quarter in negative territory.

-   **Net PnL (Red Line)**: Indicates the strategy's performance after accounting for transaction costs. The net PnL follows the gross PnL but ends lower due to the costs, accentuating the losses towards the end of the quarter.

-   **Trend**: Both lines trend downwards towards the end of the quarter, suggesting that the strategy was less effective during this period, or market conditions were not favorable for the EMA crossover strategy employed.

In summary, the trading strategy had a challenging quarter, with the net outcome reflecting a loss after accounting for transaction costs.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2022Q4

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2022_Q4.png")

```

-   **PnL Fluctuations**: Both the gross (blue line) and net (red line) PnL demonstrate significant swings throughout the quarter, indicating a high level of volatility in the strategy's performance.

-   **Transaction Costs Impact**: The net PnL is consistently below the gross PnL, reflecting the impact of transaction costs on the strategy's profitability.

-   **Mid-Quarter Recovery**: After an initial dip into negative territory, both lines show a recovery, with the gross PnL reaching a peak around mid-quarter before declining again.

-   **Quarter End Decline**: Towards the end of the quarter, both PnL lines trend downwards, with the net PnL showing a larger drop into negative territory, suggesting the strategy incurred losses that were exacerbated after accounting for transaction costs.

In summary, the trading strategy had periods of profitability during the quarter but ultimately concluded with a downturn, resulting in a net loss as of the end of the quarter.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2023Q1

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2023_Q1.png")

```

-   **Upward Trend**: Both the gross (blue line) and net (red line) PnL show an overall upward trend, indicating that the trading strategy was generally profitable during this period.

-   **Transaction Costs Impact**: The net PnL, while following the same general trend as the gross PnL, is consistently lower, which reflects the impact of transaction costs on the trading returns.

-   **Steady Performance Growth**: The strategy's performance appears to improve steadily over the quarter, with some fluctuations, but the upward trajectory is maintained.

-   **End-of-Quarter Performance**: The quarter concludes with both the gross and net PnL reaching their highest points, suggesting a strong finish for the trading strategy.

In summary, the EMA55 and EMA80 crossover strategy applied to NQ and SP futures resulted in a profitable first quarter in 2023, despite the costs associated with trading.

## PnL of results for **group 1** -- quarter 2023Q2

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group1_2023_Q2.png")

```

-   **Fluctuating Performance**: The graph shows significant swings in both gross (blue line) and net (red line) PnL, indicating a volatile performance throughout the quarter.

-   **Impact of Transaction Costs**: There is a clear gap between the gross and net PnL, demonstrating the effect of transaction costs on the strategy's profitability.

-   **Mid-Quarter Volatility**: The strategy experiences substantial ups and downs in the middle of the quarter, with a notable peak followed by a sharp decline in both gross and net PnL.

-   **Quarter Conclusion**: The quarter ends with a downward trend in both lines, although the gross PnL remains above zero, while the net PnL dips below, reflecting a period of losses, especially after accounting for transaction costs.

In summary, the trading strategy had a challenging second quarter in 2023 with high volatility and an overall decline in profitability, particularly after transaction costs are considered.

## Finally selected strategy for **group 2**

-   **AUD Strategy (EMA30 and EMA70)**: This strategy involves using a faster 30-period EMA and a slower 70-period EMA to generate trade signals for the Australian dollar futures. Each trade has a transaction cost of \$7, and the point value is \$100,000. For this strategy to break even on a round-trip trade, it needs to capture a movement of at least 0.00007 in the AUD futures price (since \$7 is the cost for a \$100,000 point value).

-   **CAD Strategy (EMA40 and EMA70)**: The Canadian dollar futures trading uses a 40-period EMA and a 70-period EMA. Similar to the AUD, the transaction cost is \$7 per trade, and the point value is \$100,000. The break-even price movement for the CAD is the same as for the AUD, at 0.00007.

-   **XAG Strategy (EMA50 and EMA80)**: The silver futures trading strategy uses a 50-period EMA and an 80-period EMA. The transaction cost is \$7, and the point value is \$5,000. To cover the cost of a round-trip trade, the XAG price must move at least 0.0014 points (\$7/\$5,000).

```

-   **2021_Q1 and 2021_Q4**: These quarters show substantial negative values across all risk-adjusted performance metrics and PnL. This indicates significant underperformance both before and after costs.

-   **2021_Q3**: This quarter stands out with positive performance across all metrics and a substantial positive net PnL, suggesting the strategy worked well during this period.

-   **2022_Q2, 2022_Q4, and 2023_Q2**: All these quarters show negative performance, with the strategy incurring losses that were magnified after accounting for costs.

-   **2023_Q1**: This quarter shows a modest positive outcome, indicating a period of recovery or successful trading, though the gains are relatively small compared to the losses in other quarters.

## PnL of results for **group 2** -- quarter 2021Q1

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2021_Q1.png")

```

-   **Overall Downward Trend**: Both the gross and net PnL are trending downwards over the quarter, indicating that the strategy was generally unprofitable during this time.

-   **Impact of Transaction Costs**: The net PnL is consistently below the gross PnL, highlighting the impact of transaction costs. Given the negative values, these costs have exacerbated the losses.

-   **Volatility**: The strategy's PnL displays volatility, with several peaks and troughs, but the general direction is negative, suggesting that any gains were temporary and ultimately overtaken by losses.

-   **Quarterly Performance**: The quarter ends with both PnL measures near their lowest points, which suggests that not only did the strategy incur losses, but those losses increased towards the end of the period.

## PnL of results for **group 2** -- quarter 2021Q3

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2021_Q3.png")

```

-   **Transaction Costs Impact**: The difference between the gross and net PnL lines shows that transaction costs have a significant impact on the strategy's returns. The net PnL is always below the gross PnL, which is expected due to the transaction fees associated with each trade.

-   **Quarterly Performance**: The strategy starts the quarter with positive momentum, experiences some volatility with ups and downs but maintains an overall positive trajectory. Both the gross and net PnL reach their highest points towards the end of the quarter, suggesting a period of strong performance.

-   **Volatility**: Despite the positive trend, there are periods of decline where the strategy gives back some of its gains, but these are followed by recoveries. This indicates some level of risk and the need for careful risk management.

In summary, the third quarter of 2021 was profitable for this trading strategy across the AUD, CAD, and XAG futures markets, even after accounting for transaction costs, although the impact of these costs is evident. The strategy's ability to end the quarter on an upward trend suggests effective management and the potential alignment of market conditions with the strategy's parameters during this period.

knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2021_Q4.png")

```

-   **Downward Trend**: Both the gross (blue line) and net (red line) PnL are trending downwards throughout the quarter, indicating that the trading strategy was consistently losing money over this period.

-   **Impact of Transaction Costs**: The net PnL shows a greater loss than the gross PnL, which suggests that transaction costs are exacerbating the losses experienced by the trading strategy.

-   **Consistent Underperformance**: The lack of any sustained periods of recovery in the PnL lines implies that the strategy did not align well with market conditions during this quarter.

## PnL of results for **group 2** -- quarter 2022Q2

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2022_Q2.png")

```

-   **Initial Losses and Recovery**: The quarter starts with significant losses, as indicated by both the gross (blue line) and net (red line) PnL dipping sharply. However, there is a recovery midway through the quarter, where the losses are recovered, and the PnL moves back above zero.

-   **Volatility**: The strategy shows a volatile performance throughout the quarter, with several peaks and valleys, indicating periods of gains and losses.

-   **Impact of Transaction Costs**: The net PnL is consistently below the gross PnL, which is indicative of the transaction costs that are being subtracted from the gross profits. This gap between the two lines represents the cost of executing trades within the strategy.

-   **End-of-Quarter Performance**: The quarter appears to end with a slight recovery in gross PnL, but the net PnL remains negative, suggesting that while the strategy had moments of profitability, the transaction costs ultimately resulted in a net loss.

## PnL of results for **group 2** -- quarter 2022Q4

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2022_Q4.png")

```

The strategy ends the quarter at a low point for both gross and net PnL, suggesting that the trading conditions, market volatility, or the strategy's parameters were not favorable during this period.

In brief, the trading strategy for AUD, CAD, and XAG futures faced a challenging quarter, with a consistent downward trend leading to significant losses, particularly after accounting for transaction costs.

## PnL of results for **group 2** -- quarter 2023Q1

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2023_Q1.png")

```

-   **Mixed Performance**: The trading strategy exhibits a mixed performance throughout the quarter. The gross PnL (blue line) fluctuates and has several peaks and valleys, indicating periods of profit and loss.

-   **Net PnL Trend**: The net PnL follows the trend of the gross PnL but remains below it, reflecting the reduction in profits due to transaction costs. Towards the end of the quarter, the net PnL shows a significant decline, ending the quarter at a lower point than where it started.

-   **End of Quarter**: Both lines end the quarter on a downward note, with the net PnL indicating that the strategy incurred losses after accounting for transaction costs.

In summary, the first quarter of 2023 was volatile for the trading strategy across AUD, CAD, and XAG futures. Despite some profitable moments, the strategy ultimately closed the quarter with a net loss, particularly impacted by transaction costs.

## PnL of results for **group 2** -- quarter 2023Q2

```{r, echo = F, out.width ='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pnl_group2_2023_Q2.png")

```

-   **Mid-Quarter Fluctuations**: While there are some recoveries and upward movements mid-quarter, these are not sustained, and the trend continues downward.

-   **End-of-Quarter Drop**: The quarter ends with a sharp decline in both gross and net PnL, with the net PnL experiencing a steeper fall, which highlights increased losses after accounting for transaction costs.

In summary, the trading strategy for AUD, CAD, and XAG futures struggled during the second quarter of 2023, with an overall negative performance and substantial losses, especially after considering the costs associated with trading.
